#TODO App

I built a todo app, by using the full stack! From the database to the server, the API client, React and React Query.


Before running this app, please intsall and run migration in your local terminal:


#1.npm i

#2. npm run knex migrate:latest

#3. npm run knex seed:run


Technology applied:

Back end (Server-side)
1. Building the database
2. Building the API
Front end (Client-side)
3. Setting the stage
4. Building the API client
5. Querying Data
